                <h2>Hangman Game</h2>
                <p>This is a hangman game that I made where you try to guess the name of the champion in league of legends. There are 3 main difficulties in this game, easy, medium and hard. There is also a special difficulty where you can choose to enter a letter that you do not want to be in the word. I built this game using python and python libraries including pygame, requests, json and random.</p>

                <h2>Covi-Bot</h2>
                <p>This is a chat bot that I made during a hackathon by myself. It has an interactive interface and you can ask this bot anything about Canada's covid-19 recovery plan. This project took around 5 hours to make and it was my first shot at machine learning. I used python to make this bot, and used a variety of libraries to build the bot including tkinter, nltk, sklearn and newspaper3k.</p>
